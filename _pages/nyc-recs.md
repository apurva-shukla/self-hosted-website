### Favorite Bakeries and Coffee Shops

- [La Cabra (Soho)](https://www.lacabra.dk/): I've only been to it twice, and everything was great.
- Cotton Bean (Crown Heights): I lived around the block and this place had my heart. They are run by a Japanese family that lives in the unit above. The Japanese know how to make a place cool live-in and cool. They attract all the hipsters of the block, but it's still low-key. I love their hazelnut pretzel pastry.
- Radio Bakery (Greenpoint): I enjoy all their sourdough sandwiches, especially the smoked salmon and the sweet pea one. The chokehold this place has on NYC bakery scene is well-deserved, although the Prospect Heights location is strangely more crowded than the original Greenpoint location.

### Favorite Restaurants

- [Ba Xuyen (Sunset Park)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L4pYMVPK9jRGeDq26): Best bahn-mi in the city. Get classic or roast pork. Extra spicy.
- [Lucky Vegetarian (Sunset Park)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dvyPkydXsvSnb1iw8): Get the mahogany fried rice. I don't know what crack they put in that.

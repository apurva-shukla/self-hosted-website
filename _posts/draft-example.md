# Work in Progress Book

This is a draft book summary that I'm still working on. Since it has `draft: true` in the frontmatter, it won't show up in the bookshelf or blog in production.

## Incomplete Notes

- Point 1
- Point 2 (need to elaborate)
- Point 3 (need to verify this)

## To-Do

1. Finish the key takeaways section
2. Add some notable quotes
3. Complete my personal reflections
4. Proofread and edit

When this book summary is ready to be published, I'll change `draft: true` to `draft: false` or remove the draft field entirely.

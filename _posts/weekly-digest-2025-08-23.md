1. [how to stop feeling lost in tech: the wafflehouse method](https://www.yacinemahdid.com/p/how-to-stop-feeling-lost-in-tech)
    - Yacine Mahdid introduces the "Wafflehouse Method" for overcoming feeling lost in tech, emphasizing a deeply personal 48-hour introspection process. The method involves taking two days off, visualizing your ideal self in five years, and systematically breaking down that vision into concrete 1-3-5 year goals. By creating a detailed directed acyclic graph of steps and consistently working towards those goals, individuals can transform their professional trajectory. The key is to focus on personal aspirations rather than external expectations, taking responsibility for one's own path and making deliberate, incremental progress.

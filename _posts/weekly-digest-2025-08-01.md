1. [Face it: you’re a crazy person](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/face-it-youre-a-crazy-person)
    - Most people daydream about ideal jobs without realizing the nitty-gritty details that come with them—like running a coffee shop or being a professor—and that’s where unpacking comes in. Unpacking means breaking down a big idea into all its tedious, repetitive, and sometimes unpleasant parts before deciding if it’s really for you. The truth is, most careers demand a kind of craziness because they involve tons of daily grind that only a few passionate (or crazy) people are willing to endure. So if you really want to succeed or be happy in your chosen path, you’ve got to embrace that madness and love the details nobody else sees.

2. [Relentlessly Resourceful](https://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html)
    - Being a great startup founder boils down to being "relentlessly resourceful," which means not just being determined but constantly adapting and trying new approaches to overcome novel challenges. This quality is the opposite of being "hapless," or passively letting circumstances control you. While some people naturally have this trait, it can also be taught or brought out in others, especially those used to authority. If you're wondering what makes a founder great or who to team up with, ask yourself if they’re relentlessly resourceful—because that’s the real secret to getting stuff done in the startup world.

### Favorite Bakeries and Coffee Shops

- [La Cabra (Soho)](https://www.lacabra.dk/):
    - Arguably the best almond croissant in the city.
- [Cotton Bean (Crown Heights)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HxQgQHmoY62PG1Xk8):
    - I used to live around the block and this place had my heart. They are run by a Japanese family that lives in the unit above. The Japanese know how to make a place cool live-in and cool. This place attracts all the hipsters of the block, but it's still low-key. I love their hazelnut pretzel pastry.
- [Radio Bakery (Greenpoint)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/RDtnwQMYJj3vM8ng9):
    - I enjoy all their sourdough sandwiches, especially the smoked salmon and the sweet pea one. The chokehold this place has on NYC bakery scene is well-deserved, although the Prospect Heights location is strangely more crowded than the original Greenpoint location.

### Favorite Restaurants

- [Ba Xuyen (Sunset Park)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/L4pYMVPK9jRGeDq26):
    - Best bahn-mi in the city. Get classic or roast pork. Extra spicy.
- [Lucky Vegetarian (Sunset Park)](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dvyPkydXsvSnb1iw8):
    - Get the mahogany fried rice. I don't know what crack they put in that.

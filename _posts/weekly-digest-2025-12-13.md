1. [“Nothing to See Here:” On Life at Russia’s Feral Frontier - Anthropology News](https://www.anthropology-news.org/articles/nothing-to-see-here-on-life-at-russias-feral-frontier/?ref=thebrowser.com)
    - In Russia’s Far East, what looks like untouched wilderness is actually the afterlife of empire. Through a visit to Sakhalin’s vanishing village of Tikhoe—with its buried houses and overgrown roads—the piece challenges frontier romance and state propaganda (like the Far Eastern “Hectare” program) that sell the region as empty and ripe for settlement. The author argues these landscapes were made “wild” by 20th-century upheavals: Indigenous displacement, Soviet urbanization and agriculture, then post-1990s collapse and abandonment. Locals describe this change as odichanie—a feral drift—marked by overgrowth, neglect, and a sense of civilizational decline, not a return to pristine nature. “Neither a timeless wilderness nor a stagnant ruin, these feral landscapes are a testament to the ebbs and flows of environmental and political histories in Russia’s remote periphery.”

    - In New York’s perpetual din, an 11-person DEP Leak Detection team listens for the city’s quietest crisis: water slipping through its 6,800 miles of pipes. Working mostly at midnight with Lmic contact microphones—stethoscopes for streets—they identify the creek-like whoosh of small leaks amid trains, HVAC clangs, and distant music. Catching leaks early prevents the gushing main breaks that flood streets, halt subways, and suspend utilities, in a century-old underground “spaghetti” delivering a billion gallons a day. Each shift they auscultate about six miles—just 0.08% of the system—embodying the slow, repetitive stewardship that keeps cities running, while reminding us of the infrastructure that sustains daily life. "Stewardship might take time, but it is through constant listening that the endless web of people, things, and places that our urban infrastructure becomes perceptible." They’re 11 public sound engineers among 300,000 city workers keeping New York humming.

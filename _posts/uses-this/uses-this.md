### Software

- [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/): The virtual machine manager I use to run my homelab and a bunch of other services. It was a Reddit recommendation for running a homelab, and it's been fantastic.
- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/): I've been using it for a while now, and it's been great. I've been able to automate my home, and it's been a lot of fun.
- [AdGuard Home](https://adguard.com/en/adguard-home/overview.html): I've been using it to block ads and trackers across my network, and it's been a game-changer.

### Hardware

- [Macbook Pro 16"](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/): My daily driver for work and personal projects.
- [Apple Magic Keyboard](https://www.apple.com/magic-keyboard/): The best keyboard I've used.
- [Apple Magic Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/magic-trackpad/): Pairs perfectly with the Magic Keyboard.

1. [Face it: you’re a crazy person](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/face-it-youre-a-crazy-person)
    - Most people daydream about ideal jobs without realizing the nitty-gritty details that come with them—like running a coffee shop or being a professor—and that’s where unpacking comes in. Unpacking means breaking down a big idea into all its tedious, repetitive, and sometimes unpleasant parts before deciding if it’s really for you. The truth is, most careers demand a kind of craziness because they involve tons of daily grind that only a few passionate (or crazy) people are willing to endure. So if you really want to succeed or be happy in your chosen path, you’ve got to embrace that madness and love the details nobody else sees.

2. [Relentlessly Resourceful](https://www.paulgraham.com/relres.html)
    - Being a great startup founder boils down to being "relentlessly resourceful," which means not just being determined but constantly adapting and trying new approaches to overcome novel challenges. This quality is the opposite of being "hapless," or passively letting circumstances control you. While some people naturally have this trait, it can also be taught or brought out in others, especially those used to authority. If you're wondering what makes a founder great or who to team up with, ask yourself if they’re relentlessly resourceful—because that’s the real secret to getting stuff done in the startup world.

4. [Attention is your scarcest resource](https://www.benkuhn.net/attention/)
    - Attention is a limited resource. Benn explains the struggle of trying to split focus between management and programming early in their career, leading to messy results. They highlight the importance of dedicating 50%+ focus on one thing to truly excel and suggest strategies like caring deeply, monotasking, dodging unnecessary obligations, and timeboxing minor tasks. By prioritizing focus and minimizing distractions, Ben improved his management skills over time. It’s a relatable reminder that juggling too much kills creativity and progress, so protect your attention like it’s gold.

5. [Seagull management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seagull_management)
    - Seagull management is a style where managers only swoop in when they think there's a problem, making quick decisions without really understanding the situation. Imagine a noisy seagull that flies in, dumps waste, and flies away. Sounds very familiar.

6. [Engineering a culture](https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2024/03/31/engineering-a-culture/)
    - Oxide recently tackled a routine bug, but the way their team handled it highlighted the strong, collaborative culture they've built. A big part of that culture centers around their weekly Demo Friday sessions, where anyone can showcase their work, fostering curiosity, learning, and peer appreciation company-wide. Their non-hierarchical, open environment encourages communication, curiosity, and teamwork, backed by deliberate cultural choices like uniform compensation and feedback without formal reviews. While creating this culture is hard and requires balance, the team passionately defends and values it as a core part of their success.

7. [3 - Oxide Hiring Process / RFD](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0003)
    - Oxide is shaking things up by blending hyperscaler system insights with open data center energy to create integrated hardware-software server solutions. They look for candidates who embrace this integrated mindset and can balance collaboration with independent focus, creativity with practicality, and confidence with humility. Instead of solely relying on traditional interviews, Oxide values real work samples, writing, and analysis to truly understand a candidate’s abilities across different roles. They believe assessing a mix of aptitude, motivation, values, and integrity through tangible work is the best way to find the right fit.

8. [Reflections on Founder Mode](https://bcantrill.dtrace.org/2024/09/02/reflections-on-founder-mode/)
    - Paul Graham’s concept of “Founder Mode” highlights the challenge founders face in balancing multiple roles while avoiding the trap of blindly following convention, which he calls “Management Mode.” The key to staying true to a company’s mission, as illustrated by Oxide’s experience, lies in a strong, writing-focused culture that documents values and processes, helping build trust and clarity across the team. Trust, often underrated by Graham, is crucial for empowering teams rather than micromanaging them. Ultimately, founders should focus on creating systems that foster trust to help their companies grow and thrive authentically.

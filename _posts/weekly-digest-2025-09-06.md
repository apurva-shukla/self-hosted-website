1. [The fallacy that the next new feature will suddenly make people use your product at andrewchen](https://andrewchen.com/the-next-feature-fallacy-the-fallacy-that-the-next-new-feature-will-suddenly-make-people-use-your-product/)
    - The "Next Feature Fallacy" argues that simply adding more features won't automatically make users engage with a product. Most new features fail because they target already engaged users or require too much investment. The key is focusing on features that impact non-users and casual users, particularly during onboarding. The article illustrates this with a "tragic curve" showing steep user drop-off, where typical metrics might see only 20 out of 1000 initial visitors remaining active after 30 days. Successful product development requires understanding user lifecycle and creating low-effort, high-value initial experiences.

2. [A Startup Founder To Scaleup CEO's Journey from $0 to $25billion (Halliganisms)](https://www.sequoiacap.com/article/a-startup-founder-to-scaleup-ceos-journey-from-0-to-25billion-halliganisms/)
    - Brian Halligan shares insights from his journey as HubSpot's CEO, emphasizing the critical shifts required when scaling a startup. Key lessons include maintaining a customer-centric culture, aligning team vectors, embracing transparency, and recognizing that leadership evolves from hands-on execution to strategic inspiration. He stresses the importance of avoiding compromise, continuously learning, and being authentic. Halligan advises CEOs to absorb complexity, pass down clarity, and understand that work can be both serious and fun. Ultimately, success comes from building something meaningful that can endure beyond the founder's tenure.

3. [How to Hire Growth ⚡️](https://substack.gauravvohra.com/p/how-to-hire-growth)
    - Gaurav Vohra argues that hiring for growth roles requires finding a "hell yes" candidate by focusing on two critical skills: CPU (raw intelligence and problem-solving) and speed (fierce pace and bias-to-action). His interview process involves multiple rounds designed to deeply assess these qualities, with an emphasis on identifying candidates who are not just smart, but can rapidly execute and drive results. The key is to look beyond a lengthy skills list and instead evaluate a candidate's fundamental problem-solving ability and momentum.

4. [We only hire the trendiest](https://danluu.com/programmer-moneyball/)
    - The article critiques tech hiring practices that prioritize candidates from "trendy" backgrounds over actual skill and potential. Companies like TrendCo systematically reject talented developers who don't fit a narrow profile, focusing instead on recent graduates from top schools or those with currently fashionable credentials. This approach limits talent pools, increases hiring costs, and overlooks skilled professionals with diverse experiences. The author suggests alternative strategies like "Moneyball" hiring, investing in training and mentorship, and improving workplace tools and processes to maximize employee productivity.

1. [Yes, I Texted the Number on the Sign](https://katebingamanburt.substack.com/p/yes-i-texted-the-number-on-the-sign?ref=thebrowser.com)
    - Kate Bingaman-Burt discovers and interviews Landon, a Portland-based roof cleaner who creates vibrant, hand-painted signs advertising his services. Through a text conversation, she learns about his creative process: he paints signs at night while watching sitcoms, carefully selects sign locations, and enjoys adding playful doodles. Landon's signs, mounted with heavy-duty screws on telephone poles around the city, reflect his love for drawing and represent a charming, human approach to local advertising that stands out in a world of generic marketing.

    - Harvey Lederman explores the potential meaning of human life in a future where AI surpasses human capabilities in virtually every domain. He wrestles with the existential dread of losing work and discovery as core sources of meaning, ultimately arguing that while the transition may be emotionally challenging, a post-instrumental world could offer new forms of purpose. These might include pursuing artificial projects, self-fashioning, maintaining relationships, and finding value in understanding for its own sake, rather than being the first to discover something.

5. [Everything I know about good API design](https://www.seangoedecke.com/good-api-design/)
    - API design is a delicate balance between familiarity and flexibility, with the primary goal of not breaking existing user implementations. The success of an API depends more on the underlying product's value than its technical elegance. Designers must prioritize stability, avoiding breaking changes whenever possible, and using versioning only as a last resort. Key principles include supporting simple authentication, implementing idempotency for action-based requests, using cursor-based pagination for large datasets, and providing rate limits. The fundamental mandate is to create an API that is intuitive, reliable, and minimally disruptive to existing integrations.

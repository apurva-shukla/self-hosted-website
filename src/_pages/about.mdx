### About Me

My background is anything but linear. It’s been a journey through law, investment banking, social impact, and product management that has given me a unique perspective on how to build and grow a business.

Today, I work on the Growth team at [Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/), where my role requires being a jack of all trades—a little bit of a Product Manager, marketer, data engineer, and data analyst. My work supports a team of 12 SDRs, generates around 250 qualified demos a month, and contributes ~$2 million in ARR each month.

I love the work I do because:
1.  **The People:** I get to work with an incredible team. Rippling's talent density is one of the highest I've ever seen.
2.  **The Scale:** I get to work at an unprecedented scale in the GTM world, touching millions of emails and users.
3.  **The Role:** Every day, I feel like I'm helping shape a new, hybrid role in the tech world that blends product, data, engineering, and marketing.

### How I Got Here

My professional story started with a law degree from [NLS, Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Law_School_of_India_University). While I enjoyed the pursuit of legal learning, I quickly realized a career in law was not for me.

I pivoted to finance, working for two years as an analyst in the investment banking division of Deutsche Bank. Based in Mumbai and Hong Kong, I focused on M&A advisory for industrial companies. I enjoyed the intellectual challenge and the intensity, but I wasn't a fan of the always-on nature of the work.

From there, I took my first leap into the startup world. For two months, I slept on a friend's couch to help get his company off the ground and realized I was not yet prepared for the ambiguity of an extremely early-stage venture. 

Seeking more structure, I joined a [social-impact consulting firm](https://www.fsg.org/) in Mumbai. I worked in 2 areas: First was creating a [succesful market for play-based early education at affordable private schools in Urban India](https://www.fsg.org/initiatives-programs/program-to-improve-private-early-education-pipe/). The second was in finding [what makes sanitation markets](https://www.fsg.org/resource/creating-viable-and-sustainable-sanitation-enterprises/) take off in India, Cambodia, and Uganda. I enojed the problem space, loved my colleages and the travel to varied places. I didn't like that advisory work could sometimes be client-affirming than truth-seeking.

After two years in consulting, I got into my dream program: a [dual Design + MBA at Northwestern](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/mmm-program/). I left my job in February 2020 and headed to Havelock Island for a one-month solo vacation, completely without internet or worldly comforts. When I reconnected after 3.5 weeks, I discovered the world was in the grips of the COVID-19 pandemic. Soon afterwards, Northwestern put my visa paperwork on hold indefinitely, I chose to drop-out, and joined an early stage startup.

At [Leegality](https://leegality.com) I was the the first Product Manager after the CEO. It was a crazy experience that, in hindsight, changed the course of my career. I learned to speak engineering, brought some order to the chaos, and faced my own shortcomings under the real pressures of the job. In my 1.5 years there, we grew from 11 to ~55 employees, and I helped set up the PM and design org for long-term success.

I still wanted that MBA, so I applied to Kellogg again, got in, and begrudgingly left Leegality. I moved to the US in 2021 and, during my program, interned as a PM at Google Cloud. Unfortunately, due to the tech downturn, there were no return offers in my year, and I found myself recruiting for months after graduation.

Thankfully, that search led me to [Rippling](https://www.rippling.com/) in October 2023, where I found a Growth role in NYC that perfectly leverages every single part of my unconventional journey. I've been here ever since.

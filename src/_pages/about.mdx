### Current endeavors
I am a growth PM/GTM engineer at [Rippling](https://rippling.com) where I work on acquring new customers in the US market.

### How I got here.
I moved to the US in 2021 to do a dual-degree MBA/MS in Design Engineering at Northwestern University.

Before that, I was the first PM at [Leegality](https://leegality.com) taking the seed stage to Series A. I also did a brief PM internship at Google on the Network Security team within GCP.
